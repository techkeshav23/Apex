Challenge V: Retail [ABFRL]
About the business: A leading retail brand seeks to revolu8onize its sales experience by deploying an
AI-driven Conversa8onal Sales Agent that seamlessly operates across online and physical channels.
This Agent must emulate a top-8er sales associate—guided by natural, personalized dialogue—while
orchestra8ng specialized Worker Agents to handle tasks from product discovery through checkout
and post-purchase support.
Problem statement: Customers face fragmented experiences when moving between online
browsing, mobile app shopping, messaging apps, and in-store interac8ons. Limited bandwidth
among sales associates leads to missed up-sell and cross-sell opportuni8es. The goal is to increase
Average Order Value (AOV) and conversion rates by offering a unified, human-like conversa8onal
journey that an8cipates needs, provides tailored recommenda8ons and facilitates sales across all
channels.
Goal: The team should design an Agen8c AI solu8on where the Sales Agent:
1. Engages customers via web chat, mobile app, WhatsApp/Telegram, in-store kiosk or voice
assistant
2. Understands preferences and context (e.g., past purchases, store loca8on, current
promo8ons) and guides customers toward relevant products
3. Coordinates mul8ple Worker Agents to handle inventory checks, personalized
recommenda8ons, promo8ons lookup, payment processing and order confirma8on—
culmina8ng in a seamless purchase or booking (e.g., “reserve in-store for try-on”)

Tips for par)cipants
• Omnichannel consistency: Maintain session con8nuity when moving between channels
(e.g., chat → in-store kiosk)
• Sales psychology: Use persuasive, consulta8ve language—ask open ques8ons (“What
occasion are you shopping for?”), suggest complementary items (“These shoes pair well
with…”) and handle objec8ons gracefully
• Edge-case demonstra)ons: Show how the Agent recovers from scenarios like payment
failures, out-of-stock items or a request to modify an order
• Modular orchestra)on: Keep Worker Agents loosely coupled so new capabili8es (e.g., GiNwrapping Agent) can be added easily
